This small program initates a link between the Katana robot and the first
COM port (COM port enumaration can start differently between different OS;
this file was run under Linux and there the first COM port has the number
0; under Win32 the number would be 1!).
After the initiation a connection check will be performed and the user will
get the result; this program should be a base for further programs, which
are using the libKNIBase library to control the Katana robot.
